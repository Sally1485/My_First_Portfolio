        <p>Hey there! I am aspiring front-end developer. It is a new career path for me with little or no experience with tech skills
            but one thing I am confident in, is the ability to learn and adapt to new environments. I am excited to do hard things and create amazing things.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>With my background, I come from a Ga-Adamgbe ethnic group in Ghana. I had my basic education in a private school in Accra. 
                I also completed my high school education in St.Mary's Senior High School and just last year I bagged a degree in Natural Resource management in KNUST.
            </p>
            <p>My hobbies include reading and writing. Recently I have found a hobby in meditating for about 20 minutes and 
                I plan on moving up the time to an hour of meditation
            </p>
            <p>Lastly my skills include coding and designing wireframes and webpages</p>
